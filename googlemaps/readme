Eg. use the url
http://maps.google.com/maps?q=http://host/main.kml

main.kml contains details about how to query the CGI script, myschool_kml.pl

Not complete, you need to host the files somewhere if you want to use it in Google Maps.
Though you can still use the CGI script to generate a KML file viewable in many mapping applications.

This was based on the concept at: http://maps.google.com/maps?q=http://toolserver.org/~para/GeoCommons/GeoCommons-simple.kml
