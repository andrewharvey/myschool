= Background =

A bunch of data about schools in Australia was released by ACARA on their
www.myschool.edu.au web site. They did not release the raw data, hence I wrote a
scraper and parser to take their data and convert it into a more reusable form.

= Notes =

postcodes.csv came from http://www1.auspost.com.au/download/pc-full.zip

When using the data keep in mind of the footnote for the Student attendance
rate. "For Victorian government schools this data is calculated using Prep to
Year 12 data for the full 2008 year and is not directly comparable to others."

I have provided some tab separated value files of most of the database tables
filled with data. I am under the impression that this is legal as per Telstra 
Corporation Limited v Phone Directories Company Pty Ltd [2010] FCA 44
http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2010/44.html

The geolocation may or may not be accurate, the same goes for the rest of the 
data in those data files provided.

= Usage =

1. Create a database and load the schema,

   $ createdb myschool
   $ psql myschool --file schema.sql

2. Fill the postcode database,

   $ ./add_postcodes.pl postcodes.csv
   
3. Run the downloader (consumes a lot of download!)

   $ ./get.pl
   
4. Run the parser, (uses HTML in database, no redownloading. but will try to use
google for geoencoding, unless you comment that out. This process may consume a
lot of RAM.)

   $ ./parser.pl
