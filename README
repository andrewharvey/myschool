= Background =

A bunch of data about schools in Australia was released by ACARA on their www.myschool.edu.au web site. They did not release the raw data, hence I wrote a scraper and parser to take their data and convert it into a more reusable form.

= Notes =

I'm still tuning bugs, and I'm yet to run a full ./get.pl (because there is a lot of data downloaded). I'll probably find some more bugs when I do that run.

postcodes.csv came from http://www1.auspost.com.au/download/pc-full.zip

= Usage =

1. Create a database and load the schema,

   $ createdb myschool
   $ psql myschool --file schema.sql

2. Fill the postcode database,

   $ ./add_postcodes.pl postcodes.csv
   
3. Run the downloader (consumes a lot of download!)

   $ ./get.pl
   
4. Run the parser, (uses HTML in database, no redownloading. but will try to use google for geoencoding, unless you comment that out)

   $ ./parser.pl
